## Project: CliniCal

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark patients with specific colours.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as it allows the user to visualise the list of patients in a more colourful manner.
  * Highlights: This enhancement enhanced my knowledge and experience with linking JavaFX UI elements to the backend logic of the applicaiton.

* **New Feature**: Added the GUI of the appointments/calendar view, via jfxtras library.
 * Justification: This feature was a core feature of our product, where users are able to add appointments to a list and visualise them on a calendar.
 * Highlights: This addition of adding an external library to the project allowed me to gain essential knowledge on the gradle dependency system, and the steps of integrating an external library into a java project.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the UI layout (Pull requests [\#82](), [\#230]())
  * Wrote additional tests for additional features in the application (Pull requests [\#155]())

* **Documentation**:
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added the introduction to the document and the guide to set up the repo for development.

* **Community**:
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [Forum activities](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/dashboards/contents/forum-activities.html#16-kim-kwon-ktaekwon000-16-posts))
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [\#81](), [\#44]())
  * Some parts of the calendar feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([ArchAngel Developer Guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w11-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#81-acknowledgments))

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (jfxtras) to the project ([\#82]())
